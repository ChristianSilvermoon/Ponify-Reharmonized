# Ponify Reharmonized
This is a fork of the *original* [Ponify](http://pterocorn.blogspot.com/2011/10/ponify.html) intended to make it once more compatible with modern browsers.

For a complete list of changes, see the commit messages.
For the most part, unless I add a new feature, not much should change from how it originally functioned.

An archive of the original source code can be found At [ngyikp/Ponify-extension-archive](https://github.com/ngyikp/Ponify-extension-archive)

Years ago, Ponify was my *favorite* browser extension!
Thank you Ben for creating this lovely add-on.
Whatever you're doing these days? Good luck to you!
